Are you on the job hunt in the Australian tech market? Looking forward to applying to your dream companies? In this post, we will cover the experiences of three software engineers from various backgrounds, different countries, and different situations(one of them taking care of a newborn baby) who successfully found tech jobs in Australia that were meaningful to their careers. 

How did they find themselves a perfect tech job? The topics below will uncover what they think helped make their job search easier.

# Networking: 

It matters that you get in touch with the tech community around you. It helps you reach out to people who have been on a similar journey that you are going through. You may find people looking to team up with someone like you. Explaining his initial job search days in Australia, 

Sagar Ghimire a software engineer at Finder says,”* I came to Sydney from Kathmandu, Nepal in July 2018 with my wife who was starting her Master’s degree in IT. I started looking for jobs online through portals like Seek, Indeed, LinkedIn, and such. I got a few interviews but it didn’t get much past that. We started going to tech meetups around the city to learn about the tech industry here, during which I got in touch with the Nepalese tech community. One of the people I met was Geshan who is working as a Lead Software Engineer at THE ICONIC. He introduced me to a project called ResPos that a handful of the Nepalese techies were contributing to at that time.”*

Let’s say you now found a project/company you are interested in. What do you do if it doesn’t offer any positions currently that you feel confident about? 

Monica Mendes, who is a physiotherapist turned software engineer shares how to get in touch with relevant people. She is now a software engineer at Domain, one of the most sought after tech companies of Australia.* *

*“You may frequently find job ad postings that require a lot more experience than you have. But if you really want to work for/with them,  give it a try to talk directly to any of the people from there and express your interest. If they are not keen to proceed with you for some reason, it would be for the best.” Now you know that probably that’s not the best place to start your career seeing that as a junior you gonna need a lot of people's support.” she shares. *

## Battling Job anxiety: 

How do you look at failure and what do you say to yourself? It seems that your mindset plays a huge role in keeping your mental health in check when the job search gets tedious. 

On this subject, Sagar suggests, *“Get used to rejections. They are part of the process. Rejection does not always mean you have failed, oftentimes the companies are looking for something very specific which may not be the right thing for you. Do your research to find out if the company and its culture feel like a place you could fit into.”*

> “I applied for over 200 jobs and interviewed for about 20 roles before I got my first two offers in 2019. Learning from rejections and applying them to my next interviews really helped me.” -

Some people break down mentally when they need a job urgently and can’t find one sooner. Some others face adversities with everything they have. For example, It’s inspiring to see how Iryna Prokopenko, a software engineer at Tyro, went about her job hunt while also managing to care for her baby. 

*“I sent my resume to The Iconic (for the first time)in Australia and they called me.  I almost died I was so nervous  🤪😂  but I was glad to hear the recruiter say that I had cleared the first stage of their hiring process. I was emotionally overwhelmed because this came at a time when I couldn’t afford childcare so I ask my mom to come to Australia and take care of my son while I was doing all these interviews”, she reminisces. *

> *“How to find a job? You should be motivated, that's all. I found a job in a new country, without a PR visa (on a fiance visa) with a baby on my hand, without English and previous experience.” -*

In an empathetic note, Monica shares how we may never feel like we are ready but we have to take a leap of faith anyway. She says, 

*“From what I know, I would say that every junior's big question is always "When will I land my first job?". The job-hunting process is exhausting to everybody, but being a newbie itself makes this journey a little more daunting. Unfortunately, people are preferably looking for someone who has years of experience and/or rarely has time to mentor/teach you, so as a junior, most of them expect you to be ready."*

> *One thing that I'm always questioning is, sincerely, we are never absolutely ready - even if we say we are, we all know that, by the end, we’re gonna do the best that we can and learn by doing (if we get a chance)But, ready ready... NEVER! There is always something that we haven’t even heard about.*

# &#xA;Giving back through side projects: &#xA;

Turn it around and instead of looking for what you can get; look for people and places that need your help. You may never know what might turn into a sustainable work opportunity. Monica leads by example here. She has involved herself in many events and communities that have helped her grow as a professional. You can read more about her work [here.](https://monicamendesmontanha.github.io/) 

 As a solution to take such a step forward she says, 

*“Be involved with the community, attend and volunteer to organize tech events and conferences. Be willing to mentor someone where you can despite being a “newbie” (we know how easy it is to find someone that knows more than us, but the inverse is also true, help someone that has taken their first steps).”*

# Finding a tech job as an immigrant in Australia: &#xA;&#xA;

Iryna shares her struggle of searching for tech jobs as an immigrant while having a language barrier and a child to take care of. 

*“I have two degrees: finance and engineering. I used to work in an insurance company as an investigator and later shifted to IT in the same company. I feel like my experience as an IT professional made it a little easier for me to look for similar jobs in Australia. After I received a fiance visa, I left for Australia. At some time, I got pregnant and gave birth to my son there.*

*After a year I got a wife visa and now I wanted to be more secure with my finances. At first, I wanted to go to the coles or woolies to unpack food as a job, but my husband guessed that they wouldn’t hire me unless I could speak fluent English(I never learned English, I spoke french). As an alternative, I thought I would bake cakes and cook other food. However, my mother in her good humor suggested that someone may get poisoned and blame my food and turned down the idea.*

*Over time I realized that I could try to find office work. I started looking for positions like business analyst, product owner, etc., and everywhere I needed relevant experience and perfect English.”*

Monica recollects her early days of looking for a tech job as a software engineer in Australia. 

*“I am a Brazillian and a former physiotherapist who used to work helping kids’ development for 7 years. I decided to change my career to become a software engineer. My journey began when I came to Australia in 2017. *

*I reckon my big challenge was dealing with anxiety in trying to be myself, learning a different language, in another country and another culture, we know that things like that take time, also at the same time I was switching careers which usually comes along with a big level of uncertain in every single step that you take as everything is new.”*
