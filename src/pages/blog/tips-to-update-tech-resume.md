 To stand out from the stack, you need to craft your resume like an art masterpiece that is meant to cater to a specific audience.  

Your resume is your first contact with the recruiter. You’ll want the best version of yourself to be represented. But let’s face it, not all techies are great resume writers and competition is pretty high. Based on some interviews with tech entrepreneurs and research, here are tips to update your resume. 

# Include personal and online projects

Include any personal projects or volunteer work that you think adds value to the tech role you are applying for. Working on these projects apart from your regular work makes a strong case that you are genuinely interested in what you do. 

Maybe you have a GitHub, GitLab, or bitbucket to host your projects, maybe you have volunteered for a community project. Including these projects, tells more about you while also differentiates you from the rest of the stack. 

# Add impactful details to your work experience

When describing your work experience, refer to any tangible impact it made. This solidifies the work you have done more powerfully than to say that you have worked for so and so company for the last five years. 

For example, you were a Junior developer at XY company for 4 years. Instead of writing 

*Junior Developer 
Worked on banking software at  XY solutions for 4 years *


Say, 


*Junior Developer 
XY solutions: 4yrs
Redesigned banking software that improved customer satisfaction by 60%*

Alternatively, you can also focus on the skill you have learned. Recruiters are more interested in how exactly you might be beneficial to their company. 

*For example, Instead of saying 

Cyber-security Analyst

Worked with network admin on efficient network traffic analysis*

 You could say, 

 *Cyber Security Analyst
 
-Performed network traffic analysis by learning the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to improve efficiency by 5%*


The words you use to describe your experience also matters a lot. Using the right keywords help you communicate precisely while also helping to improve your chances to get chosen further in the process. Andrew Stetsenko, a tech entrepreneur and founder at CVcompiler suggests that “*Having the marketable tech keywords in your resume (surely, you should list the ones you're good at) will definitely boost the chance to be invited for interviews”.* In his article called [40 words to include in your Developer’s resume,](https://hackernoon.com/40-words-to-include-into-your-developer-resume-fk6o3y7v) he lists a good example of how to use keywords to make an impactful resume. 


# Keep your resume relevant to the job you are applying to 

Shortlist your skills to highlight those that are most relevant to the job at hand. When you apply for any tech role, the job description is a great way to find out what kind of a person they are looking to hire. Based on this job description you can tweak your list of skills on your resume to include the most relevant ones only. 

It’s not necessary to cramp up your resume with everything you have done so far. 
For example, let’s say you are applying for the position of Project Manager.
You could mention coding skills: 

*Coding: HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Python*

You could mention related skills like :

*Proficiency in Agile, Scrum, and Kanban *

Maybe you could skip general ones like MS Office, Documentation, etc. 

If each role you are applying to is different than the other, it makes sense to have variations of your resume to cater to each job type.

# Error-free readable resume

The way you write your resume will also translate to the way you will do your job, for most recruiters. A simple error-free resume will have: 
-  Attention to detail in spelling and grammar. 
- legible fonts and appropriate white spaces: 
- A simple reverse chronological order to show your best achievements
- an appropriate design template that doesn’t overpower your content.
