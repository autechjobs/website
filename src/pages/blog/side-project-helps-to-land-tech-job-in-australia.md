At AU tech jobs(ATJ), 2020 was our first year in operation. We came together as a remote team of volunteers who cared deeply about making tech job search a hassle-free process in Australia. This article is about contributors to AUtechjobs - three software engineers who found incredible ways to learn and grow beyond their limitations and used a common side project - ATJ to land a full-time tech job in Australia.

They talk about challenges in job search, what they learned working at ATJ, and how they navigated their way to successfully land the prized full-time tech job, all during the crippling pandemic. Let’s get cracking!

## **Ajeet Chaulagain**, *Front-end Software Engineer, Melbourne, AU*

Ajeet has been into creating his own pet projects since he was in high school. Talking about how he grew up, he reflects, “ Born and brought up in Kathmandu, Nepal as a 90’s kid I had limited access to mobile phones or computers. However, I created a simple toy snake game using Action Script in Adobe Flash that received a lot of support and recognition from my loved ones. It might have been a pivotal moment in life that set my direction towards a career in the tech industry.” 

### Initial challenges faced during the job search process:  

Just out of college in Australia, with a master’s degree from the Swinburne University of Technology, Ajeet found himself in an array of job hunting queues only to be rejected after the initial interview. 

He further exclaims, “Based on the skills mentioned in the job description, I would select multiple jobs to apply for that matched my own skillset. **But I rarely heard back**. If I did, I was mostly being rejected. It was then that I decided to hit pause on the job hunt and find out why I wasn’t getting hired” 

### How AUtechjobs(ATJ) happened to him: 

In the process of working on his skills through personal projects, Ajeet connected with the project lead (another volunteer at ATJ) through which he joined the team at ATJ. “After an engaging and fruitful conversation, I was sold on the idea of contributing to ATJ as a frontend engineer",he recalls.

### The learning process: 

“Through this single side project, I got a chance to enhance  several of my skills, including:

*   Working effectively with a group of an agile team to release the features through a robust Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline.

*   How to think about edge cases while adding features in a production-grade application to avoid potential issues 

*   Writing clean, maintainable, and balanced test cases.

*   Effective communication between team members to solve the problem.

*   How to do effective code reviews.

Also, one of the exciting things for me was a custom Slack Bot at Au Tech Jobs. I really loved deploying features and bug fixes added to the desired environment(Staging, Production) by simply mentioning a bot with a single line of command. 

Had I not decided to contribute for ATJ and other side projects I would probably still be frustrated by not landing any exciting offers from my job search,” he rejoices.

### Landing tech jobs as a freelancer: 

Ajeet is now working as a successful freelancer by contributing to open source projects and building a solid portfolio. “I am bagging more interviews now”, he concludes. 

For recent graduates like him, side projects are a great way to get hands-on experience with applying what you have learned as well as staying upbeat in the current market.

>  “ Looking back, my decision to prioritize on enhancing my skills by running a side project end to end and contributing to open source projects allowed me the space to build a practical experience that I previously lacked.”
