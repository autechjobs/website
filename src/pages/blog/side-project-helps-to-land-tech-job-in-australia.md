At AU tech jobs(ATJ), 2020 was our first year in operation. We came together as a remote team of volunteers who cared deeply about making tech job search a hassle-free process in Australia. This article is about contributors to AUtechjobs - three software engineers who found incredible ways to learn and grow beyond their limitations and used a common side project - ATJ to land a full-time tech job in Australia.

They talk about challenges in job search, what they learned working at ATJ, and how they navigated their way to successfully land the prized full-time tech job, all during the crippling pandemic. Let’s get cracking!

## **Ajeet Chaulagain**, *Front-end Software Engineer, Melbourne, AU*

Ajeet has been into creating his own pet projects since he was in high school. Talking about how he grew up, he reflects, “ Born and brought up in Kathmandu, Nepal as a 90’s kid I had limited access to mobile phones or computers. However, I created a simple toy snake game using Action Script in Adobe Flash that received a lot of support and recognition from my loved ones. It might have been a pivotal moment in life that set my direction towards a career in the tech industry.” 

### Initial challenges faced during the job search process:  

Just out of college in Australia, with a master’s degree from the Swinburne University of Technology, Ajeet found himself in an array of job hunting queues only to be rejected after the initial interview. 

He further exclaims, “Based on the skills mentioned in the job description, I would select multiple jobs to apply for that matched my own skillset. **But I rarely heard back**. If I did, I was mostly being rejected. It was then that I decided to hit pause on the job hunt and find out why I wasn’t getting hired” 

### How AUtechjobs(ATJ) happened to him: 

In the process of working on his skills through personal projects, Ajeet connected with the project lead (another volunteer at ATJ) through which he joined the team at ATJ. “After an engaging and fruitful conversation, I was sold on the idea of contributing to ATJ as a frontend engineer",he recalls.
