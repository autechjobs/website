Starting or changing into a new career is an important life decision. Top that with starting a whole new life in another country, and you have got yourself a ticking explosion of consequences waiting to happen if you don't make the right choices. 

As a foreigner, its a bit more of a challenge than just to fill out a couple of job applications, walk into an interview and there you have a job. There are many other factors that come into play before you decide on a job possibility.  On the australian front, here are a few things you could consider doing before you take the plunge.

# Do some basic research: 
No matter how far along you are on your tech job search, research provides a deeper understanding of the market. But especially as a foreigner, it pays a great deal to know what you might be getting your foot into. So before you dive in, maybe explore some current tech trends in Australia. 

Australia’s tech landscape is ever-growing. Just by how much? Well, the country is home to 25 million people as of November 2020. Almost one million out of that population is currently employed within the tech industry.

According to [AlphaBeta’s report,](https://alphabeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/australias-digital-dividend-final.pdf) the tech sector contributes around  $122b which makes for 6.6% GDP of the country. If it catches up to global leaders like the US, it has a potential of $207b contribution to GDP. 

# Find out what tech roles are in demand: 

With the changing dynamic of work amidst the pandemic, many jobs were lost. The tech sector has had to facilitate new dynamics like working from home and has seen steady growth in job demand. So,few areas are ranking high to be the top tech roles that will dominate in 2021 and the coming years. Some of them are:

## Cybersecurity: 
Ever-evolving security threats have positioned the government to increase cybersecurity in 2020. To support this, Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, [released a paper](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-pubs/files/cyber-security-strategy-2020-discussion-paper.pdf) in 2019 asking for opinion and feedback to replace its 2016 strategy. It would likely be investing $1.35b in the coming years towards this direction. 

This can catapult the number of jobs for cybersecurity in the near future.

## Artificial Intelligence : 
This is one area that has been continuously thriving. According to a report from Australian council of Learned Academes(ACOLA), industrial automation is going to significantly increase the use of AI over the next few years.

As a tech job seeker, you will need to be proactive in acquiring these skills to keep yourself relevant to such in-demand jobs in the market.

 ACOLA's recent [report on Internet of Things](https://acola.org/hs5-internet-of-things-australia/) also stresses the need to utilize opprtunties to improve the quality of life in Australian cities by considering a national approach on IOT. 
 
 As digitization is only going to increase in the next decade, this report shows the possibility of overcoming challenges throug IOT as well as  testing new IOT applications. 



## Cloud computing:
 According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021/), an industry analyst firm, cloud-based tech and services rank as one of the top tech trends that will dominate 2021.
