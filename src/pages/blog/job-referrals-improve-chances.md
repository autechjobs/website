Have you been waiting long to hear from companies you have applied to? Chances are that the company might have hired a referred candidate. With skyrocketing competition added with COVID related job insecurities, it may not be wise to rely just on your resume. Luckily, Employee Referrals have come to the rescue for many job seekers in such situations. Learn why and how employee referrals can effectively improve your chances of getting a job.


## What is an Employee Referral ?

When someone recommends you to the hiring manager for a vacant job position, you have a referral. Employee Referrals are usually made by an active employee of the organization you are interested in. When employees refer a candidate from their pool of networks, it adds an organic advantage for the hiring manager. With employee referral, you become a candidate that is internally pre-screened by your connection. You are  trusted to represent the company's values and ethos. So, this edge skyrockets the chance of you getting through the interview and landing the job.
