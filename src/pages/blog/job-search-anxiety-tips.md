This too shall pass. When you realize that this phase, neverending as it may seem, is temporary, it lightens the mental  weight you carry. It also helps you become hopeful about your opportunities as well as positive about your outcomes.

## Unemployment benefits
You could file for unemployment with your government. You may also be eligible for benefits depending upon various factors such as age, family status, etc. The Australian government provides unemployment benefits to its citizens and permanent residents. You can visit their website and find options for individuals as well as organizations. 

## Side hustle

## Organizing yourself 
It makes sense to start by organizing your savings and use it judiciously. It will act as a temporary financial cushion that you can rely on. Additionally, you can create a structure around activities that you’ll need to do like getting your resume ready, searching for jobs online, and managing other chores. If it has been a long time since you have had to look for a job, you can update your resume, call your career coach or mentor,  learn a new skill, and get your social media accounts like Linkedin updated. 


# 2. Keep a positive outlook
When times are tough, inspiration to do what you love can be challenging. The Australian Psychological Society lists Cognitive behavior therapy as one of the treatments for anxiety. Cognitive restructuring is a process where you change your negative thoughts and develop more positive and constructive ways of thinking. 
Keeping positive self-talk, affirmations going behind your head will help you in many ways:

## Helps to drown out negative mental chatter
Check your thoughts like a self-audit and see what you are saying to yourself. You may be thinking, “Okay, I got this, I am going to get myself a job” or you may be thinking, “ There is no way I can figure this out, I have literally applied to all the jobs out there and I haven’t heard back from anyone” Catch yourself if you are falling in the negative self-talk that involves scary thoughts about your future that arent true. 

## Helps to be your own support system
You can change your internal dialogue. For example, If you keep saying to yourself, “ I am not good enough for the jobs out there”, you could change your thought to  “I am fortunate that I am skilled, I will find something that suits my capabilities.”This way, you become your own support especially when the process is internal. A positive outlook provides encouragement to move your job search process along. 

## Helps you to plan ahead
Positive affirmations can keep worry out of your head and motivate you to work consistently towards your goal. It can boost mental well being and help you figure out how you can use available options to chart your way to a new job. 



# 3. Celebrate your progress
According to the Australian psychological society, stressful life events such as financial hardship or loss of work can be one of the triggers that cause anxiety. Take a break when you need to and celebrate what you have achieved so far. 

Got your resume updated? Send out your job applications? Did you just get back from your interview? Take some time off to celebrate your progress. Savoring your continuous efforts can propel you forward with motivation. If you can manage, a change of scene will help you get some peace too.

# 4. Reflect on your self-worth: 
Your job is definitely a huge part of your life. But it's not your entire life because we play multiple roles in family, social circle etc. We have our interests, our responsibilities and other aspects that make life-enriching. So while there is an undeniable void due to a non-existent job, you can consider taking some time out for  your loved ones or for things you love to do. This fresh perspective will help you gather support from loved ones, use referrals through your connections, or learn a skill. This way you can push back your anxiety and bring your confidence to the forefront.  

#  5. Staying physically and mentally healthy:
