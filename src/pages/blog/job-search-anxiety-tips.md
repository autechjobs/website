We all know that searching for a job isn’t a process  that we are thrilled about. But it doesn’t need to be frustrating, you can make it a learning experience. A lot of you might be going through anxiety during a job search especially given the COVID scenario. Many have been laid off, many have found themselves just out of school and little hope of finding their dream job anytime soon. 

Jobs have become people’s identity so when you don’t have a job, it feels like there is a big void to fill. Job search anxiety is very real, it happens to the best of us.  So, while you are on the hunt, here are some ways that will keep your nerves calm and set your mind towards constructive thoughts to land your dream job. 

# It is going to take time. It won’t happen within a day. 
So relax and stop worrying.  Now do what you can today, a little step every day goes a long way. Separating chunks of work to do daily, whether it is a daily routine or a checklist, complete your bit for today. And then remind yourself that you are getting there one step at a time. 

# Level up on the self-talk.
Notice what goes on in your mind, especially what you tell yourself about your job search. “ I am never going to get that job”, or “ They probably can find someone better” or “ nobody really wants me around”  are thought directions that won’t leave you feeling happy. Positive self-affirmations based on reality like, I have started this today, I have come along this far and I can do this slowly will help you be your own support. When the struggle is internal, it’s even more important to be your own coach. 

# Take a break when you need to: 
Going at it to a point where it makes you stressed isn't healthy. Take a break from your job hunt and take some time off. This will help you come back with a fresh perspective and energy. A change of scene will help you get some peace. I know it can be stressful when you are tight on budget and you have bills to pay. However, a peaceful fresh mind is always better than an anxious mind. 

# Break down your reasons for feeling anxious: 
Sit with yourself and see what is it that ticks you off. Maybe you think that the employer isn't answering your email soon enough. Maybe you think that your interviews never go well.  Maybe you feel like you can’t find the job that's right for you. Or maybe you have sent out too many resumes but haven’t heard from any and that tends to lower your self esteem. 


# Know that this isn’t permanent. It will pass.
When you realize that this phase, neverending as it may seem, is temporary. It only lasts as long as you land your next job. Realizing that this is a temporary phase helps you become hopeful about your opportunities as well as positive about your outcomes. It gives you the strength to carry on with your search.

# File for unemployment, look for options and  side gigs
First things first, file for unemployment. See if you are eligible for benefits. Organize your savings to the T so that you can use it judiciously. Next, you can look for side gigs depending on your interests that may make you part-time income while you are on the job lookout. Maybe you can put up ads on your car, maybe you can help market products online, maybe you can work at an outdoor venture. There are several ways that you can use to sustain yourself until you find something more permanent. 

# You are much more than your job.
Your job is definitely a huge part of your life. But it's not your entire life because we play multiple roles in family, social circle etc.We have our interests, our responsibilities and other aspects that make life enriching. So while there is an undeniable void due to a non-existent job, you could take the time you have and invest on your loved ones or things you love to do, until you find yourself a job. 
This will help you gather support from loved ones, network with your connections, or learn a skill. This way you can push back your anxiety and bring your confidence in the forefront.
